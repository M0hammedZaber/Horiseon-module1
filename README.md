# Horiseon-module1

## Description

This is a refactor of the Horiseon website to use code that is more understandable and readable like 'HTML' then the code that is present at the moment which is 'Div' which doesn't tell the website anything. This will be code that follows the accessability standards so all people can understand the website.

I will be changing all the 'Div' elements to HTML semantic code so the website knows exactly what the code is referring to. I will also be changing the CSS as well as the HTML because changing just the HTML will make the website unreadable and has to match up with the CSS. 

I will also be making sure the elements align in order such as the H1 followed by H2 etc in sequential order.

I will be making sure that the website is lifted for search engines to liase properly to its optimum level.
