            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                increase your lead generation.

        <!-- added 'alt' tag for lead generation image on the website  -->
        <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="funnel indicating the customer lifecycle" />
        <p>
            Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly
            to your website.
        </p>
        <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
        <!-- added 'alt' tag for brand awareness image on the website  -->
        <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt="Lightbulb capturing a thinking moment" />
        <p>
            Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility
            for your business.
        </p>
        <h3>Cost Management</h3>

        <p>
            As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer
            need to advertise your page.
